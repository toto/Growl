growlnotify is a command-line tool to enable you to send Growl notifications from the command line and from shell scripts.

This package includes a manual page which fully documents the tool's interface.

Please do not use growlnotify as a replacement for our Growl framework (for Cocoa and MacRuby) or bindings (for Python, Ruby, etc.).
